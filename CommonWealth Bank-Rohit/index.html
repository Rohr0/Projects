    <h1>Tips for Financial Cybersecurity</h1>
    <h2> 1.Be careful what you click on.</h2>
    <p> Don't open links in emails or download stuff from unknown sources.
        Instead,
        go to your bank's website or app to check
        for updates. Clicking on shady links can put harmful software on your device and expose your personal info.
    </p>
    <h2> 2.Use strong passwords.</h2>
    <p>
        Don't share your passwords, and change them regularly. It's a good idea to use
        a
        password manager app to keep track of
        them.</p>
    <h2> 3.Turn on extra security.</h2>
    <p>
        Use something like two-step verification. It means you need both a password
        and another code to get into your accounts.
    </p>
    <h2> 4.Keep your device safe.</h2>
    <p>
        Use antivirus software and keep your computer and phone up to date. If you
        store info in the cloud, check if it's secure
        and understand the costs.
    </p>
    <h2> 5.Use your own device.</h2>
    <p>
        Avoid public computers for your bank stuff. They might have sneaky software. If
        you must use one, clear your history and
        use strong passwords.</p>
    <h2> 6.Be careful where you browse.</h2>
    <p>
        Make sure you see "https" in the website address and a locked padlock
        icon. Don't visit other sites while you're logged
        into your bank. Always log out when you're done.</p>
    <h2> 7.Watch out on public Wi-Fi.</h2>
    <p>
        Some networks in public places aren't safe. Wait until you're on a
        trusted, secure network to access your bank accounts.
        At home, use strong Wi-Fi encryption and passwords.</p>
    <h2> 8.Check your bank statements.</h2>
    <p>
        Look at your account activity and statements as soon as you can. Make
        sure your bank has your current contact info. If
        you see a mistake or something strange, tell your bank right away.</p>
